Codes from Udemy course **‘Golang: How to Build a Blockchain in Go Guide’** by Jun Sakai and Yuko Sakai.

I think this course is great for developers who want to get comfortable with all the primitives of the blockchain technology. I enjoyed the course because the instructor chose an appropriate pace for presenting the lectures. Although my version is similar to the original, I made some changes, such as creating modules like block and transaction instead of having all the codes related to blockchain in one place.
